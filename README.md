## Description

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. If the player suggests a letter that is in the word, the letter is revealed in its correct position(s). If the letter is not in the word, the player loses one life. The game continues until the word is guessed correctly or the player runs out of lives.

This Python implementation of Hangman provides a fun way to practice and improve your vocabulary and spelling skills.

## Features

- A list of 500 unique words for variety.
- ASCII art to represent the hangman at different stages.
- Simple and interactive command-line interface.
- Tracks guessed letters and lives left.
- Option to play multiple rounds.

## Installation

To play the Hangman game, you'll need to have Python installed on your system.

## How to Play
The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list.
You will see the word as a series of underscores, representing each letter in the word.
Guess a letter by typing it into the console and pressing Enter.
If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct position(s).
If the guessed letter is not in the word, you will lose a life, and part of the hangman will be drawn.
Continue guessing until you either reveal the entire word or run out of lives.
You can play multiple rounds by choosing to play again after each game.
